    <!-- It is basically AJAX programming, 
        It basically contains state for every step , like
    0	UNSENT	Client has been created. open() not called yet.
    1	OPENED	open() has been called.
    2	HEADERS_RECEIVED send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
    3	LOADING	Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
    4	DONE	The operation is complete.        
    -->

    const requestUrl = "https://api.github.com/users/anushreyjain";
    // first we make a new Object of XML request
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // open takes 2 parametere, one is method of request and other is url
    xhr.open("POST", requestUrl);
    // open does not get called by itself, we need to call it
    xhr.send();

    // to know that state is being actually changed or not, we can use
    console.log(xhr.readyState);

    // now to monitor state contineously, we can use
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
      console.log(xhr.readyState);
      // now to get resposnse when we reach last state
      if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
          // NOTE - this will always give response in string type.
          // so you need to convert into JSON to access property
          const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText)
          console.log(data);
